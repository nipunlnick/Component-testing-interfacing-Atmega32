# Atmega32 Component Testing

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C code examples for testing various components interfaced with the Atmega32 microcontroller. Each example focuses on a specific component, providing detailed instructions and code to help you set up and test the component with Atmega32. This repository is designed to assist students, hobbyists, and engineers working on embedded systems projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each dedicated to a different component. Inside each directory, you will find:

- **C Code**: The main code file(s) to test the component.
- **README.md**: A detailed explanation of the component, including setup instructions and how to run the test.
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Visual diagrams to help you connect the component to the Atmega32.

### Components Covered

- **[GSM Module (SIM900A)](./GSM_Module/README.md)**
  - Code to test GSM communication for sending SMS alerts.
  - Circuit diagram and setup instructions.

- **[Stepper Motor](./Stepper_Motor/README.md)**
  - Code to control and test a stepper motor using Atmega32.
  - Circuit diagram and detailed control instructions.

- **[Alarm System](./Alarm_System/README.md)**
  - Code to test an alarm system triggered by specific conditions.
  - Setup guide and connection details.

- **[Additional Components](#additional-components)**
  - Placeholder for future components like sensors, displays, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following:

- Atmega32 microcontroller and development environment (AVR Studio, Atmel Studio, etc.).
- Basic understanding of C programming.
- Familiarity with interfacing components with microcontrollers.
- Required components (GSM Module, Stepper Motor, etc.) and necessary wiring.

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nipunlnick/Component-testing-interfacing-Atmega32.git
   cd Component-testing-interfacing-Atmega32
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Component Directory:**
   Each component has its directory. Navigate to the one you are interested in.
   ```bash
   cd GSM_Module
   ```

3. **Review the README.md:**
   Each directory contains a README.md file with setup instructions and code usage.

4. **Compile and Upload:**
   Use your preferred development environment to compile the C code and upload it to the Atmega32.

5. **Test the Component:**
   Follow the instructions in the README file to connect the component and observe the results.
